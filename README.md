# Skin Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on the detection of 7 different types of skin cancer using deep learning models. Leveraging the HAM10000 dataset and advanced neural networks like EfficientNetB4, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50, the system achieves an impressive accuracy of over 90%.

## Features

- **Multi-Class Classification**: Detects 7 types of skin cancer.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved over 90% accuracy with EfficientNetB4.
- **Optimized Models**: Compared performance using EfficientNetB4, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50.
- **Dataset**: Utilized the HAM10000 dataset, a benchmark for skin cancer classification.

## Dataset

The HAM10000 dataset consists of 10,015 dermatoscopic images representing 7 different skin lesion categories:

- Actinic keratoses (AKIEC)
- Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
- Benign keratosis-like lesions (BKL)
- Dermatofibroma (DF)
- Melanocytic nevi (NV)
- Melanoma (MEL)
- Vascular lesions (VASC)

## Models Used

- **EfficientNetB4**: Provided the best results with over 90% accuracy.
- **MobileNetV2**: Lightweight and efficient with respectable performance.
- **ResNet50**: Achieved good accuracy and served as a baseline comparison.
